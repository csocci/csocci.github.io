        <p>Scott Nash started MOM’s at the age of 22 with an initial investment of $100 as a home delivery business out of a garage. On July 2nd 1987, MOM’s made its first sale delivering to a customer who lived in Rockville, MD.</p>
        <p>A big break came when Scott’s roommate, who worked at a local organic retailer that went out of business earlier that day, put a note on the door telling people to go to MOM’s instead.</p>
        <p>After three decades, MOM’s has stores in six states and DC, employs over a thousand people, and has created a culture centered on protecting and restoring the environment.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <div class="h2_sub">Living our values</div>
        <p>One of MOM’s core values is <em>We Rise by Lifting Others</em>. We believe that “without a doubt, our most valuable asset here at MOM’s is our people.”</p>
        <p>We stock a higher volume of organic products than any other store, including organic produce. If organic options are not available, we have progressive standards that include a list of 250+ banned ingredients! In addition, MOM’s does not allow products to target children with licensed cartoon characters on the package.</p>
        <p>Our local food bank program also donates unsold food to over 60 local food banks, soup kitchens, and churches, benefiting our communities and reducing food waste.</p>
